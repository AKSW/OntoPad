# OntoPad

OntoPad is a simple editor for RDF data, e.g. Resources, Classes, and Properties. On top of the simple RDF layer it provides ways to visually interact with SHACL shapes.

OntoPad is designed to run in you web browser and to be connected to a SPARQL Endpoint. To be able to share the data you create it works best with the [Quit Store](https://github.com/AKSW/QuitStore) (actually currently only supported SPARQL Endpoint).


## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

Now the OntoPad should be locally available at `http://localhost:8080/` or some other port, if port `8080` is used already.

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your tests
```
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
