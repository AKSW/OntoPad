## OntoPad

The OntoPad is a simple RDF editor written in JavaScript.
With the Vocabulary module it provides the possibility to generate a simple RDFS vocabulary and visually compose SHACL shapes based on the vocabulary.
The OntoPad is setup on a [Quit Store](https://quit.aksw.org/) which makes the system collaborative by providing the possibility to exchange data via Git.

The demo installation is available at [https://demo.ontopad.aksw.org/](https://demo.ontopad.aksw.org/), the Vocabulary module at [https://demo.ontopad.aksw.org/#/voc](https://demo.ontopad.aksw.org/#/voc).

Feel free to send us a [pull-requestst](https://github.com/AKSW/OntoPad/pulls) if you want to fix something or provide additions.
